# PyQGIS Learning Journal - Jay Sojitra
My PyQGIS notes and practice scripts

Welcome to my PyQGIS learning journey! 🚀

This repository is where I track my progress learning **PyQGIS** (Python for QGIS) from Ujaval Gandhi's Masterclass.  
It contains my notes, scripts, and completed exercises as I explore the PyQGIS API, QGIS plugins, and geospatial Python programming.
