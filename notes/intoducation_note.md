We can download it from the official QGIS website https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html
We are using the Python Console in QGIS to write and execute our PyQGIS code.

we also usded the vs code editor to write our PyQGIS code. We need to install the QGIS plugin in vs code to run PyQGIS code in vs code editor.

*What is PyQGIS ?*
PyQGIS is a Python library that allows us to use Python programming language to interact with Q

what can you used python in QGIS for ?
--> issue commands from python Console
--> automate tasks
--> write a custom functions ( later )
--> write plugins
--> data processing
--> custom standalone applications ( create own tool bar) 
--> create a new applications ( Not cover --later )
